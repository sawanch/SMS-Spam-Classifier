# SMS Spam Classifier

## Project Overview
The SMS Spam Classifier is an emerging project focused on tackling the widespread issue of unsolicited messages in today's digital world. Our aim is to differentiate effectively between spam (unsolicited) and ham (legitimate) SMS messages, using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
In an era where communication is predominantly digital, spam messages have become a significant concern, cluttering inboxes and potentially leading to security risks. Our project addresses this issue by providing a reliable way to filter out these unwanted messages.

## Current Progress
- Initial project setup complete.
- Preliminary research into NLP and ML techniques for spam detection.

## Stay Updated!
This project is in its early stages, and there's much more to come! We encourage you to regularly check back for updates on our progress and new features.
